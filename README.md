# Xplate API Server
This is a spring boot java server, containing various restful apis for my personal use.

You can access these at <https://api.xplate.dev>.

## Building
_You need to have Java 25 before you start_

Run `sudo ./gradlew clean build shadowjar`, then you can find the jar in `/build/builtJars`
